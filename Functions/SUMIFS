To sum betwween two dates you can use;

=SUMIFS(Incassi[INCASSO];Incassi[DATA];">="&"01/01/2021";Incassi[DATA];"<="&"31/01/2021")

this will sum up all the Cash from 01/01/2021 to 31/01/2021

where the column in which the dates are set is called 'Incassi[DATA]'

remember thas sumifs has a different structure than sumif

first the sum range then the criteria range and finally the criteria

while in the sumif
is the criteria range then the criteria and finally the sum range
