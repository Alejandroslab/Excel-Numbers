How to export your basic Microsoft Word custom settings
If you need to transfer basic settings you have customized,
such as default font family and size, your macros, etc.,
to your laptop or elsewhere,
this can be achieved by replacing Word’s default normal template
with the one containing your own changes.


To locate your customized normal template go to Word’s
 Options > Advanced > General > File Locations.
Open the File Locations panel to find the User Templates location.
Copy and paste you template folder in the relevant folder of any other Office installation you are using,
 or just in your backup folder to transfer it later wherever you need.
To export your Ribbons and Quick Access Toolbar:
 Go to Options > Customize Ribbon > Import / Export
 , to save or restore your Ribbon settings.
 This includes the Quick Access Toolbar settings.
