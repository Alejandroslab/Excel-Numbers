if you divide a table with a blank column it will be sorted only a side of
the table and the other side will remained unchade.

If you want to make a more complex sorting you have to use the button sort

if you want to sort a table based on the day you have to select button sort and
selecct order->custom list (from the dropdown menu)

the same result can be obtained with the command filter

to clear filters jus use 'clear' on the 'Data' tab (small button on the side of filter)

To filter using a range you can use 'number filter' or 'text filter'
