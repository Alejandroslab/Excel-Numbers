Numbers guide

Hi,

Does anyone know how to have a SUMIF apply if a cell contains a certain text?

Example:

Product Sales
Pen $132
Magic Pen $5
Books $10


I'd like a SUMIF so that if the product name contains "Pen" it would add the sales, result in example = $137.

Can anyone help me please??
Thanks a lot!

ANSWER:
=SUMIF(A2:A4,"*pen*",B2:B4)


If you use & between the "*" and the cell reference it works fine.

example:

=SUM(SUMIF(A2:A4,"*"&B1&"*",B2:B4))

A 'fun' side effect of this is if the cell reference is blank it will pull everything and sum the whole range. (since ** = anything)


if you have a lot of SUMIF remmeber that could be useful a pivot table
