You have to use ROW function
ROW function will retrieve the number of the row in which you are 
This means the number at the left side in the bar

In order to add a column that will automatically add numbers when you add a new row:
if you have already created the table you have to undo that 
you can undo that going to 'Table Design' and click on 'Convert to Range'

Now in your desired column click on the first cell in the first row and type:

=ROW()-1

you can change you -1 with -2,-3,-4 accordingly to your position
otherwuse (when your table starts not properly at the beginning of the sheet) you will not get 1 but
you will get e.g. 5.

then click and drag the formula until the last cell

Now recreate the table (or create it if you have not have done it already)
ctrl+t

DONE!
now if you want to create a new row you will see that a new number will automatically be created!
