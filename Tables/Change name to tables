Most of the times when you have lot of table you may need to
rename your tables.
This could be useful when you want to operate
a lot between your tables.
Renaming will easy the work.
You will be able to recall columns quickly with the format
Mytable[Mycolumn]

This last way of indicate data is called 'structured reference'

to change the name
select any cell inside your table

go to 'Table Design' (that only activates when you are inside a table)
Go to the 'Properties' section

Below 'Table Name' you can change it

CAREFUL! Just select ONE cell and not all the content
with ctrl+a

If you select with ctrl+a and rename it
you are not renaming the table even though the table name appears
you are just renaming a section, a group of cells!
In this case you will not be able to recall the columns
with the squared brackets like

Mytable[Column1]

excel will not suggest anything because you have renamed
just a portion of the table
