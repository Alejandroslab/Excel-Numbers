this is very common when you have macros

go to developer tab and click on macros.
if you have macros, word will always prompt to save any files
even if you have not made any change

When the macro "fires",
the system registers that as a change,
even if no changes were made. Hence the save prompt.

therefore no real issue and no solution to this
