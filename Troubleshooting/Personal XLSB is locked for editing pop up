All you need to do is remove the Excel12.xlb file and
the XLSTART directory located here: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel.
Then, start Excel and the directory and file will get recreated automatically.

NOTE: The system won't let you delete the directory
 and file right away; what you want to do is move
 them to a temporary alternate location.
 You can delete these old files after you restart Excel
  (and the directory and file automatically get recreated).
