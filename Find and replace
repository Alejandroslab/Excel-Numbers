To find only in a specific column
Select column and ctrl + f (not command but ctrl)

to open directly replace windows
ctrl+h


REMEMBER!
you have to be careful regarding spaces. As for example looking
for the term 'Con' is not like looking 'Con ' (you see the space)

in the first case the program will find all the words that start
with 'Con'
Like
'Con'
'Converted'
'Conversion'
...

in the latter case it will find only
'Con' words

if you click on 'Find all'
it will appear a list of all the terms

you can manually select some of them (even with shift key) to
highlight them and then you can performa replace function on just then
selected ones (if you need to replace)


you can also delete doble spaces like "  "

"my dog is  beautiful"

you can delete the double space
just find "  " (just press twice the space)
and then replace with

" " (just press once the space)

(then you can replace all if you wish)

DONE!
