if you want to delete a word you can do this with replace

if in a cell we have

'I eat an apple in the morning'

and i want to delete 'apple'

i will look for

'apple '

note that there is a space. if you don't put the space and leave blank the replacemente text

you will get:

'I eat an  in the morning'

you can notice a double space. therefore just add a space in the textbox 'Find what'

Find what: 'apple '

Replace with: ''
In replace with you will just put nothing!
