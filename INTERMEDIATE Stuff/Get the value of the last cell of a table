you have a table that will refresh adding more rows
you want to get the last cell on the last row every time
and you want that your formula updates automatically

just use:

LOOKUP(2,1/(A:A<>""),A:A)

2 and 1 are necessary
while A:A is the column in which to lookup
<>"" means 'different than empty'
