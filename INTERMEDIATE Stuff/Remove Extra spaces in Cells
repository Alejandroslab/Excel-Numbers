You can usually:

TRIM(A1)

or TRIM(CLEAN(A1))

or:
select your cells (columns or whatever)
then:

ctrl+h
put a space in find (or ctrl+j inside 'find' if you know that is not a space)
and replace all


Sometimes the character that we are trying to delete is not a space but could
be another symbol.
To inspect the char code of this symbol
use, (supposing that you will work with cell A1)

CODE(LEFT(A1))
and

CODE(RIGHT(A1))

to inspect the left side of the cell and then the right side

if the char code is 160 then you will know that the character
is a breaking line and not a space then you
should process in this way:


=SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(160), "")

it will replace the char 160 with nothing
