first create the table where you want to
store the data that will appear as
options inside the dropdown menu

then select all the data and RENAME THE SELECTION
give it a name like

Clients_Table

REMEMBER! You have to name your selection ending with '_Table' otherwise it will not work!

This will create a renamed ranged (different from the name of the actual table)
with this you will be able to use data validation


to rename the table just use the little text box on the left side
after selecting the cells!
When you click enter nothing will happens.
The cell will go back to its previous name but it has saved the selection as a table
you can find it in the Name Manager


then go to your cell where you want to create the dropdown
(you will be able to copy them just using autofill)

Select tab 'Data' then 'Data Validation' (shortcut: alt+a+v+v)

in data validation in validation criteria select "List"

In Source select or press F3 to point your table renamed as

Clients_Table

(first inser an '=' equal sign)

select tab 'Input message' and deselect the input message
(this could be annoying as it would display everytime you click on your selected cell)

click ok

now you can perform autofill to copy this setting to more cells

REMMEBER! when you have multiple tables then you have to rename them
in table2 table3, etc

for example
if you have renamed the first table as
Clients_Table

you have to rename other table with different name otherwise data validation will not work

_______________________________________________________________________
If you create multiple names with the same selection they will not be overwritten
you have to delete them from 'Name Manager'
