when you want to create a new row just position yourself immediately below
It will create a row above the selected row

For columns, position yourself to the right where you want to create a new columne
(in the left it will be created the new column)

To create more empty columns select the number of columns that you want
(it does not matter if they are empty or not) then right click and 'Insert'
and the new columns will be created (the same for rows)
